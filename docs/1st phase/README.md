# WebProgramming - Expense calculator
You come home after a long day at school or at work, want to relax a little but 
the first thing you see when you get through the door is a pile of bills that you
have to pay. You already know it's going to be a challenge to get through the month,
and just to think you wanted to save up for a car... 
Or maybe you saw a great documentary about a place on the other side of the world,
a little paradise on Earth! You have to go there, it's not even a question. Ah well,
your wallet doesn't agree with you.
And yeah, yeah, you know it's completely your fault.. But the money just kind of evaporates.

What if I tell you that you can stop that? It's not so hard, all you have to do is
organize your finances and Expense Calculator is an easy way to do it. All you need
is a good plan and a little of selfdiscipline and you're one step closer to being 
able to get through the month without worrying and even save up a little something. 

Sounds good, right? It's because it is. The application is an easy way to keep track
of your incomes and expenses, all you need to do is submit them, and it will categorize
them for you. Now you'll know exactly how much you spend on different products/services
and also how much money you have left at any moment. It also encourages you to make a
goal and set up a date. That, I think, is the most important part of a good financial
plan, because we all know that until it's written somewhere the date will probably just
get pushed forward.

Does that sound like you? It sure does like me and most of my friends, so I guess that
the target audience would mostly be young people with high hopes for independent future.

The application was tested on computer in following web browsers: Google Chrome,
Mozilla Firefox,  Microsoft Edge and Tor and responsive design was also tested on
mobile devices. Chrome didn't cause much trouble, but making the application compatible
for the other browsers was probably the hardest task for me as a complete beginner 
in web programming, because i had no idea why some things like date validation and
using global events worked in Chrome but not in the other browsers. I had to put 
a lot of work into the assignment and I'm proud I've got it up and working.

I probably spent most time figuring out how Javascript and submiting forms works,
I also learned and used some PHP, which I think is the best part for me, because it
is really useful. So far i liked the project, I've already learned a lot of useful
things and I think I'll learn even more in the second phase of project.
